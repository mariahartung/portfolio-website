          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Worldup is a mobile vocabulary app that enables language learners to learn words in everyday context and talk to native speakers and peers from all around the world.
          </p>
          <h3>Project Background</h3>
          <p>The project was part of the introductory course in the UX design program by CareerFoundry.
            The goal was to build a mobile app that empowers people to learn new vocabulary.
            The app is meant to be used on-the-go for 5-10 min sessions.
            The focus of this project was more about learning how to apply design thinking to a given problem and project than to create a polished design.
            The project ended with a low-fidelity prototype.

        <div>
          <h3>How might we design an app that empowers people to learn new vocabulary?</h3>
          <p>Learning vocabulary with apps for work or vacation can be repetitive and boring when
            words are too easy and learned on their own. It´s also easy to forget new words when not applied regularly.
            Moreover, it can be hard to know if you pronounce words or use them correctly without human feedback of native speakers.
          </p>
          <p>Worldup solves the problem by providing a way for language learners to learn words in everyday context they are used.
            It also connects them to native speakers and peers from all around the world to practice what they learned to help them test their knowledge and memorize vocabulary better.

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p>I started by conducting a competitive analysis of 3 competing apps to discover how to build a better app for my users.
            For the analysis I chose Memorion, Lexilize Flashcards and Quizlet.
            Through an analysis of their launch experience, navigation and ease of task completion I was able to
            assess their strengths, weaknesses and identify opportunities to position my app in the market.

          <h3>User Interviews</h3>
          <p>In order to identify user needs and the problem that needs to be solved,
            I conducted 4 user interviews (2 in-person, 2 remotely) with 4 participants.
            I recruited them by pitching my project in an english class at a local adult education center,
            asking random students at university and through slack.
            Participants were between 20-49 years old and screened for recent experience with learning a new language and learning vocabulary with apps.
          </p>
          <h4>Main Goals</h4>
          <p>The goal of the interviews was to find out:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> How people approach learning vocabulary</li>
            <li> What methods they use</li>
            <li> What experience they have with learning vocabulary with apps</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Key Findings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> Users learn vocabulary for work, vacations or learn about new cultures.
              They learn new languages because they want to advance in their careers or to speak fluently with native speakers on vacations.</li>
            <li> Vocabulary is learned through repetition. Writing words down, reading them out loud and recalling them is often the preferred method to memorize new words.
              Users also learn best through a combination of methods like typing, listening and speaking.</li>
            <li> Users need to learn words in contexts and apply them to everyday life to make them stick.
              Learning words in categories or sentences helps them to memorize words better, so they can use them in daily contexts to express themselves confidently and freely.</li>
            <li> Users need interactions with others and apply what they learned in conversations.
              Human interaction with native speakers is an important way to test how good their knowledge is, but many apps lack the option to talk to native speakers directly.</li>
            <li> Vocabulary apps like babbel or busuu are too easy for users. They get frustrated when they learn words they already know and feel like there´s nothing new.
              They want to learn intermediate and advanced words based on their skill level to get a sense of accomplishment. </li>

          <h3>Empathizing with the User</h3>
          <p>In order to empathize with the user and make my research more human and memorable,
            I created a proto-persona called Francesca Mancini.

        <div>
          <h3>User Stories & Job Stories</h3>
          <p>Next, I created user and job stories to understand what Francesca wants to accomplish in what context in order to
            define functions and solutions for my app from a human perspective.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h4>User Stories</h4>
            <ul>
              <li> As a language learner, I want to learn vocabulary in contexts like categories,
                so that I can use these words in daily situations and express myself freely and confidently in english. </li>
              <li> As a social person, I want to talk to others in english,
                so that I can directly apply my vocabulary in conversations and get instant feedback on what I need to improve.</li>
              <li> As a rational person, I want a logical connection between categories and words I learn,
                so I don´t get confused when I learn vocabulary.</li>
              <li> As a curious person, I want to learn advanced words I don´t know yet,
                so I can expand my vocabulary and make progress in learning english.</li>
              <li> As a book lover, I want to add words I encounter in books or TV shows,
                so that I can learn vocabulary that interests me and don´t have to be limited to learn the predefined words in the app.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Job Stories</h4>
            <ul>
              <li> When I´m on my break at work, I want to quickly learn business vocabulary in short exercises,
                so I can apply words later that day in meetings with international clients.</li>
              <li> When I read books or watch TV, I want to pull out my phone and add vocabulary I encounter to my app so I can study these words later.</li>
              <li> When I´m on my commute from home from work, I want to take a short playful quiz in English vocabulary,
                so I can have some fun learning vocabulary and distract myself a bit from work.</li>
              <li> When I have some spare time, I want to meet new people and stay in touch with people from abroad by chatting or calling them,
                so I can make meaningful connections and apply my vocabulary in conversations about different topics.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Now that I gained enough clarity through user research, the proto-persona and the user/job stories I could define the problem and propose a potential solution:
          </p>
          <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
          <p><i>Francesca Mancini needs a way to learn vocabulary by interacting with others and learning advanced words in relevant contexts,
              because she wants to advance in her career, apply her knowledge to everyday situations and assess her progress by getting instant feedback from others.</i>
          </p>
          <h4>Hypothesis Statement</h4>
          <p><i>We believe that by creating a vocabulary app as a supportive social platform where language learners can call and chat with native speakers and other students
              to improve their language skills and by providing a feature to learn new words in relevant contexts via categories, for Francesca Mancini, we will achieve an increase
              in language fluency and help Francesca make faster progress in learning english.</i>

          <h3>Task Analysis</h3>
          <p>Now that I have an idea of who I´m designing for and the problem, I want to understand how users will navigate the app to complete their main tasks.
            I first performed a task analysis to identify key tasks Francesca would need to do in what order.
            Then I mapped out user flows for 2 main tasks: take a lesson on business vocabulary and add a new word to a category.
            User flows helped me to visualize the paths Francesca would take to accomplish her goal in the app.

          <h3>Sketching out possible solutions</h3>
          <p>Next, user flows were used to inform the prototype phase.
            I used rapid prototyping and the crazy-8 technique to come up with different solutions that could solve the problem.
            At first, I created low-fidelity wireframes on paper and then turned them into a prototype using prott to test with real users
            to validate my solution in the next phase.

            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>Now it was time to put the prototype to the test. To do so, I conducted moderated remote usability tests with 4 participants over skype.
              The goal was to test the sign up process and ease of use of basic functions of the app such as adding new vocabulary to categories or taking a lesson on business vocabulary can be completed.
              Findings of the usability tests were summarized in a short test report. Afterwards the prototype was revised based on user feedback.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h4>Test Results</h4>
            <p>Although participants could sign up to the app quickly and easily, they had severe difficulties at the other tasks.
              The errors and challenges experienced are listed below.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Issue 1: Lesson Complete Screen (Severity 3)</h5>
            <p>Participants found the lesson complete screen distracting to be displayed in the middle of the exercise,
              because they wanted to move on with the exercise and not be interrupted to be asked if the lesson was complete or not.
            </p>
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>I removed the lesson complete screen and adjusted the progress bar for users to see that their exercise is ending
              and added an “end lesson” button at the end of each exercise and quiz block to ensure they could focus on completing the exercise and know when it´s over.

          <div>
            <h5>Issue 2: Add new word screen (Severity 4)</h5>
            <p>This issue turned out to be a usability catastrophe. All of the participants were stuck on the task and didn´t know where to click to add the new word to the category,
              because the placeholder text seemed like a new word. They thought the new word was filled in already. Categories were also hard to see from the dropdown menu.
            </p>
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>To solve this, I redesigned the screen. I added a placeholder text under the textlines and added icons to make text input clear.
              The categories section was also redesigned. Instead of the dropdown menu I included tags for existing categories to make them more visible and easier to choose from.

            <h5>Issue 3: Add button (Severity 4)</h5>
            <p>Participants couldn´t find the option to add a new category and clicked on the add button to add a new word.
            </p>
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>I added a plus icon to the existing categories to make clear they would add a new category directly from existing ones.

          <ul>
            <li><b>Less is more:</b> In terms of content and options, less is sometimes more.
              If users are presented with too much content on the screen or too many options to choose from, they feel overwhelmed.
              I will keep this in mind when designing interfaces in the future.</li>
            <li><b>Have visual cues for orientation:</b> Without any visual cues people sometimes get lost in the task,
              so it´s important to guide them through the interface by providing visual cues for easy orientation.</li>
            <li><b>Importance of consistency:</b> People need consistent names and labels to not get confused.
              If the screen says add a word, they would also expect a button with the add a word label.
              I will remember this when designing buttons and screens in upcoming projects.</li>
            <li><b>Expect user´s mental model to be different from your own:</b> Solutions that work for you, might not work for the user,
              so it´s important to know they often have a different mental model from your own.</li>
            <li><b>Test early and often:</b> Test and fail early and often to learn from mistakes and create better user experiences.</li>
