                  <h3>Project Background</h3>
                  <p>The project was part of the introductory course of CareerFoundry's UX design program.
                    The <b>goal</b> was to <b>build a mobile app that empowers people to learn new vocabulary.</b>
                    The app is meant to be used on the go for <b>5-10 min sessions.</b>
                    The focus of this project was more about learning how to apply design thinking to a given problem and project than to create a polished design.
                    <b>The project ended with a low-fidelity prototype.</b> I revisited the project in April 2020 to iterate and turn low-fidelity wireframes into mid- and high-fidelity ones.

            <h3>How might we design an app that empowers people to learn new vocabulary?</h3>
            <p>Learning vocabulary with apps can be <b>repetitive and boring</b> when
              words are too easy and learned on their own. It's also <b>easy to forget new words</b> when not applied regularly.
              Moreover, it can be <b>hard to know if you pronounce words or use them correctly</b> without the human feedback of native speakers.
            </p>
            <p>Worldup solves the problem by providing a way for language learners to <b>learn words in everyday context they are used.</b>
              It also <b>connects them to native speakers and peers</b> from all around the world to <b>practice what they learned</b> to help them <b>test their knowledge</b> and memorize vocabulary better.

          <p>During the project, I applied the design thinking methodology to understand the user, define the problem, and create a user-centered solution in six phases.

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>I started by conducting a competitive analysis of <b>3 competing apps</b> to discover how to build a better app for my users.
              For the analysis, I chose Memorion, Lexilize Flashcards, and Quizlet.
              Through an analysis of their <b>launch experience, navigation, and ease of task completion</b> I was able to
              assess their strengths, weaknesses and identify opportunities to position my app in the market.

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>To identify user needs and the problem that needs to be solved,
              I conducted <b>4 user interviews (2 in-person, 2 remotely).</b>
              Recruitment of participants was done by pitching my project in an English class at a local adult education center,
              asking random students at university, and via Slack.
              Participants were between <b>20-49 years old</b> and screened for recent experience with learning a new language and learning vocabulary with apps.
            </p>
            <h4>Main Goals</h4>
            <p>The goal of the interviews was to find out:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> How people approach learning vocabulary</li>
              <li> What methods they use</li>
              <li> What experience they have with learning vocabulary with apps</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Synthesis</h4>
            <p>After the transcription of the interviews, findings were organized into three categories (thinking, feeling, doing) for analysis of user's behaviors, thoughts, and feelings.
              The key results of the synthesis are listed below.
            </p>

          <div class="wrapper">
            <h4>Key Findings</h4>
            <ul>
              <li> Users learn vocabulary for work, vacations, or to learn about new cultures.
                They learn new languages because they want to <b>advance in their careers</b> or to <b>speak fluently with native speakers on vacations.</b></li>
              <li> Vocabulary is learned through <b>repetition.</b> Writing words down, reading them out loud, and recalling them is often the preferred method to memorize new words.
                Users also <b>learn best through a combination of methods</b> like typing, listening, and speaking.</li>
              <li> Users need to <b>learn words in contexts and apply them to everyday life to make them stick.</b>
                Learning words in categories or sentences helps them to memorize words better, so they can use them in daily contexts to express themselves confidently and freely.</li>
              <li> Users need <b>interactions with others</b> and apply what they learned in conversations.
                Human interaction with native speakers is an important way to test how good their knowledge is, but <b>many apps lack the option to talk to native speakers directly.</b></li>
              <li> Vocabulary apps like <b>Babbel or Busuu are too easy for users.</b> They get <b>frustrated when they learn words they already know</b> and feel like there's nothing new.
                They want to learn intermediate and advanced words based on their skill level to get a sense of accomplishment. </li>

                    so that I can use these words in daily situations and express myself freely and confidently in English. </li>
                  <li> As a social person, I want to talk to others in English,
                    so that I can directly apply my vocabulary in conversations and get instant feedback on what I need to improve.</li>
                  <li> As a curious person, I want to learn advanced words I don't know yet,
                    so I can expand my vocabulary and make progress in learning English.</li>
                </ul>

              <div>
                <h4>Job Stories</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li> When I'm on my break at work, I want to quickly learn business vocabulary in short exercises,
                    so I can apply words later that day in meetings with international clients.</li>
                  <li> When I read books or watch TV, I want to pull out my phone and add vocabulary I encounter to my app so I can study these words later.</li>
                  <li> When I'm on my commute from home from work, I want to take a short playful quiz in English vocabulary,
                    so I can have some fun learning vocabulary and distract myself a bit from work.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>

          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>Now that I gained enough clarity through user research, the proto-persona, and the user/job stories I could define the problem and propose a potential solution.
            </p>
            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>Francesca Mancini needs a way to learn vocabulary by <b>interacting with others</b> and <b>learning advanced words in relevant contexts</b>
              because she wants to advance in her career, apply her knowledge to everyday situations, and <b>assess her progress by getting instant feedback from others.</b>
            </p>
            <h4>Hypothesis Statement</h4>
            <p>We believe that by creating a vocabulary app as a <b>supportive social platform</b> where language learners can <b>call and chat with native speakers and other students</b>
              to improve their language skills and by providing a feature to <b>learn new words in relevant contexts via categories,</b> for Francesca Mancini, we will achieve an increase
              in language fluency and help Francesca make faster progress in learning English.

                The <b>goal</b> was to test the <b>sign up process</b> and <b>ease of use of basic functions</b> of the app such as adding new vocabulary to categories or taking a lesson on business vocabulary <b>can be completed.</b>
                Findings of the usability tests were summarized in a short test report. Afterwards, the prototype was revised based on user feedback.

              <h4>Test Results</h4>
              <p>Although participants could <b>sign up to the app quickly and easily,</b> they had <b>severe difficulties with the other tasks.</b>
                The errors and challenges experienced are listed below.

              <h5>Lesson complete screen (Severity 3)</h5>
              <p>Participants found the lesson complete screen <b>distracting to be displayed in the middle of the exercise</b>
                because they wanted to move on with the exercise and not be interrupted to be asked if the lesson was complete or not.
              </p>
              <h5>Change</h5>
              <p>I removed the lesson complete screen and <b>adjusted the progress bar</b> for users to see that their exercise is ending
                and <b>added an “end lesson” button</b> at the end of each exercise and quiz block to ensure they could focus on completing the exercise and know when it's over.

              <h5>Add a new word screen (Severity 4)</h5>
              <p>This issue turned out to be a <b>usability catastrophe.</b> All of the participants were <b>stuck on the task</b> and didn't know where to click to add the new word to the category
                because the placeholder text seemed like a new word. They thought <b>the new word was filled in already.</b> Categories were also hard to see from the dropdown menu.
              </p>
              <h5>Change</h5>
              <p>To solve this, I <b>redesigned the screen.</b> I <b>added placeholder text under the text lines</b> and <b>added icons to make text input clear.</b>
                The categories section was also redesigned. Instead of the dropdown menu, I <b>included tags for existing categories</b> to make them more visible and easier to choose from.

            <p><b>Less is more:</b> In terms of content and options, less is sometimes more.
              If users are presented with too much content on the screen or too many options to choose from, they feel overwhelmed.
              I will keep this in mind when designing interfaces in the future.
            </p>
            <p><b>Have visual cues for orientation:</b> Without any visual cues it can be easy to get lost in the task,
              so it's important to guide people through the interface by providing visual cues for easy orientation.
            </p>
            <p><b>Importance of consistency:</b> People need consistent names and labels to not get confused.
              If the screen says "add a word", they would also expect a button with the add a word label.
              I will remember this when designing buttons and screens in upcoming projects.
            </p>
            <p><b>Expect the user's mental model to be different from your own:</b> Solutions that work for you, might not work for the user,
              so it's important to keep in mind they often have a different mental model.
            </p>
            <p><b>Test early and often:</b> Test and fail early and often to learn from mistakes and create better user experiences.
