              <h3>Project Summary</h3>
              <p>
                Irrelevant, vague, and complex information on professions online kept our users from gaining a realistic overview of roles and choosing the right career path.
                To solve this problem, I created the responsive web app Expert. It connects students to industry experts in tech via messaging and video calling for tailored career advice
                to help them make an informed career choice.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project was part of my certified UX design program by CareerFoundry. The web app should be free to use but requires payment for any video calls done over the platform.

              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>
                According to the representative study "Schule-und dann?" by Institut f√ºr Demoskopie Allensbach from 2014:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>More than 50% of high school students have difficulties choosing a career path.</li>
                <li>20% of students don't have a clear idea of what career path to take after graduation.</li>
                <li>35% of them don't feel informed enough about job roles, apprenticeships, or study programs.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Choosing a career path can be daunting indeed because it's one of the most important decisions students can make in their lives.
                Finding relevant information on professions online is time-consuming. Vague information on sites also makes it hard to know what to expect from a role or if it's worth pursuing it.
                After validating the problem with real users during the project, I was able to come up with a problem statement.
              </p>
              <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
              <p>
                Students need a way to get answers to their career questions from experienced industry experts
                because they can't find relevant information online to get a realistic overview of job roles in order to make a career choice.
              </p>
              <p>We will know this to be true when we see how many users use our app to get career advice from industry experts and recommend the app to others.

              To understand the problem space, I first analyzed two competing products and compiled the results into SWOT profiles.
              For the analysis, I chose edggi as a direct competitor and coachilla as an indirect competitor.
              After the evaluation I could not only reveal their strengths and weaknesses but also find opportunities for Expert to stand out in the market.
              To differentiate itself, Expert needed to have clear labeling of navigation items, autocomplete and autosuggestions for search, and an original design.

            <h3>Survey</h3>
            <p>
              Next, I carried out user research to understand the user. I ran an online survey with 16 participants to identify the most important target audience,
              find pain points in tools they use, and prioritize features that would be of value to them. The survey was distributed on Facebook, Reddit, Slack, and thestudentroom.co.uk for a wider reach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the survey stayed active for a week, the number of responses could have been higher for more reliable results. Nonetheless, I could still gather valuable insights that helped define the further course of the project.

            <h4>Survey Results</h4>
            <p>
              Survey findings showed that our main target audience is between 25-34 years old and is primarily college students.
              They mostly struggle to filter and find relevant information on careers in their current field of study.
              To make a career choice, booking calls with experts, searching for career experts, and viewing questions and answers in forums would be most helpful.
              However, findings also revealed a hesitation to use an app like Expert: 25% wouldn‚Äôt use it at all; 31.3% were unsure about it.

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p> As a result of survey findings, I narrowed down the primary user group to college students to target them for 5 interviews for a better understanding of their needs and goals.
              To recruit the right participants, I made use of guerilla research. I screened and recruited students on a local university campus and conducted the interviews on location.
            </p>
            <h4>Interviews were aimed at finding out:</h4>
            <ul>

              With this technique similar responses are grouped into clusters. These were later used to generate insights.

            <h3>Sketching out possible solutions</h3>
            <p>
              Using the sitemap, user flows, and personas, I started creating low-to high- fidelity wireframes for key features by rapidly prototyping different solutions.
              At first, I created rough low-fidelity sketches on paper, which were later turned into mid-and high-fidelity wireframes
              and prototypes using Sketch and Figma. At the end of this phase, I had a high-fidelity prototype that was ready to be
              tested with real users.

            <h3>Low-fidelity wireframes</h3>
            <p>Findings from my research gave me a good idea of what users would expect on an expert profile.
              To offer Tim and Isabel the simplest way possible to contact experts, I included two buttons on
              the expert's profile to either message experts directly or to book calls with them.
            </p>
            <p>For the expert pages, the initial idea was to lay out expert cards horizontally, including the expert's name, a related tag, a preview of his about me,
              and a view profile button, to save space and display more cards on the page.
              Through feedback, I later realized the cards were too small to account for longer expert names and multiple tags.
              So I changed the layout of the cards in later iterations to stretch them out vertically.

            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>
              To validate my solution, I conducted moderated remote usability tests with 6 participants via Skype.
              The goal was to assess learnability and errors for first-time users.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Do users understand the web app and its value?</li>
              <li> How easy can they complete Expert's basic functions for the first time?</li>
              <li> What errors do occur frequently and how severe are they?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After the tests, I used affinity mapping again to organize my findings and prioritize issues to be fixed.
              Errors were measured by using Jakob Nielsen‚Äôs rating scale. I also measured satisfaction with the single-ease-question by asking users to rate the difficulty of tasks at the end of the test.

            <h4>Test Results</h4>
            <p>
              All participants found the app simple, straightforward, and easy to use. They could complete 3 out of 4 tasks quickly and easily.
              The major area of confusion was task 2 (search for expert) and the lack of transparency for costs of video calls.
              The main challenges and errors experienced are listed below.

            <p>
              5/6 participants would have directly searched for a software developer, instead of picking an IT expert from the autosuggestions.
              As a result, I replaced irrelevant search terms with the job roles of experts and included software developers.
              I also changed the helper text in the search bar on experts' page to "enter job roles" instead of "enter field of work", which was a bit ambiguous.

              It also includes a FAQ section that answers the most common questions regarding how subscriptions and plans work.

            <h3>Bringing Expert to Life</h3>
            <p>
              After having fixed flaws in the prototype through usability testing feedback, it was time to bring Expert to life with visuals.
              To do so, I used gestalt principles and color psychology to refine the visual design for Expert.
            </p>
            <h3>Color Choice</h3>
            <p>
              As Expert is career-related, I wanted to keep the design minimal, professional, and visually appealing at the same time.
              To evoke emotions of hope and optimism in users who are unsure about their career paths, I chose a color palette with blue and yellow tones.
              While the yellow-orange color stands for the optimism of users to make a career choice,
              the blue tones represent professionalism, trust, and expertise of experts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, I created a design system to ensure consistency across our brand.
              Finally, the design was iterated based on peer feedback and accessibility guidelines.

              The expert project was a valuable experience in many respects. Going through the whole design process from start to finish brought not only joy
              but was also challenging and frustrating at times. Through multiple rounds of iterations and trial-and-error on user flows,
              journey maps, and wireframes, I learned to be open to feedback and embrace changes to ultimately improve the product for users.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also learned to resist the temptation to add a lot of features, but stay focused on the core ones, that would be valuable to users.
              As Expert is an MVP, new features will be added and validated in upcoming iterations such as a payment flow for PayPal,
              search filters, and the option to leave reviews on experts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, I learned that the quality of your research depends on the quality of your questions.
              In hindsight, I would focus on user tasks more in interviews and test mid-fidelity prototypes before moving on to high-fidelity ones.
