          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Expert was created as part of my certified UX design program by CareerFoundry.
            The goal of this project was to create a responsive web app with mobile-first approach,
            that enables anyone to instantly chat with experts in any field, to get advice on how to face their (everyday) problems.
            The web app is free to use, but requires payment for any video calls done over the platform.
          </p>
          <h3>Project Background</h3>
          <p>To find a niche people could need expert advice in, I looked at secondary research such as
            the representative study "Schule-und dann?" by Institut für Demoskopie Allensbach from 2014.
            According to this study:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>More than 50% of high school students have difficulties choosing a career path.</li>
            <li>20% of students don't have a clear idea of what career path to take after graduation.</li>
            <li>35% of them don't feel enough informed about job roles, apprenticeships and study programs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These insights motivated to find out more about the problem and create an app that would be
            focused on getting career advice from experts for people who are unsure about their career choice yet.

      </div>

      <div>
        <div>
          <h3>What´s the problem?</h3>
          <p>Choosing a career path can be daunting, because it's probably one of the most important decisions students can make in their lives.
            With all the career options and information available on professions online, how do you know what's the right career path for you?
          </p>
          <p>Browsing sites to find relevant information can be time-consuming.
            Information given is often vague and makes it hard to know what to expect from a role or if it´s worth to pursue it.
            Asking family and friends for advice doesn't always help either.
          </p>
          <p>Here's where Expert comes in. Expert fills the gap by connecting students to industry experts, so they can clarify their questions
            (via messages and calls) and get instant career advice to make an informed decision about what career path to take.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Problem Statement
          </h3>
          <p><i> Students need a way to get answers to their career questions from experienced industry experts,
              because they can't find relevant information online to get a realistic overview of job roles in order to make a career choice.</i>
          </p>
          <p><i> We will know this to be true, when we see how many users use our app to get career advice from industry experts and recommend the app to others.</i>

          <h3>Analyzing the Competition
          </h3>
          <p>I started off by conducting a competitive analysis to understand the problem space
            I'm operating in and find ways Expert could have a competitive advantage in the market.
            For the analysis I choose edggi as a direct and coachilla as an indirect competitor.
            The insights were then complied into two SWOT profiles.

          <h3>Opportunities for Expert
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Clear labeling of navigation items.</li>
            <li> Provide autocomplete and autosuggestions for search.</li>
            <li> Original design instead of copy from others.</li>
            <li> Regular marketing for more visibility and app awareness.</li>
            <li> Provide a forum feature to ask experts and view similar questions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3> Survey</h3>
          <p>Next I carried out user research to understand the user. I first ran an online survey with 16 participants,
            that was distributed on facebook, reddit, slack and thestudentroom.co.uk. to reach a wider audience.
          </p>
          <h4> Main Goals</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> Identify the most important target audience of Expert.</li>
            <li> Find out about pain points and tools used in searching for career advice online.</li>
            <li> Prioritize features that would be of value to the target audience.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/expert/survey_results_mobile.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/expert/survey_results_desktop.jpg" alt="Survey Results">
          </picture>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4> Key Results</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> Our primary users are between 25-34 years old and are either professionals or students.</li>
            <li> The majority of users feel somewhat informed about their career choices and mainly searches online
              to find out about career options they are currently studying for. Therefore, we can narrow down the target audience to college students.</li>
            <li> Primary tool used to find out more about career options are websites.</li>
            <li> Common pain points are no option to filter content (and irrelevant content.</li>
            <li> Most helpful features in an app to help with career choice are: booking calls with experts,searching for career experts and
              viewing questions and answers in a forum. </li>
            <li> Users also seem rather hesitant to use an app like expert: 25% wouldn't use it at all, 31.3% were unsure about it.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>How do survey findings inform the next step?</h4>
          <p>Survey findings helped me to narrow down the target audience to college students. They will be targeted in interviews next to gain a deeper understanding of their needs and goals.
            I also uncovered that users seem to be rather skeptical to use an app like Expert. To not make the app redundant on launch, it will be important to find out the reasons for their hesitations and what they need to trust experts more to ask
            them their career questions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>User Interviews</h3>
          <p> Next I sought out students for interviews. Through guerrilla research and recruitment on a local university campus, I was able to find 5 interviewees and conduct the interviews on location.
          </p>
          <h4>Interviews were aimed to find out:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> What are users general experiences with searching for career advice online?</li>
            <li> How do they go about searching for career advice?</li>
            <li> What pain points do they encounter in tools they use?</li>
            <li> What do users need to know about experts to trust them and contact them for advice?</li>
            <li> In what case would they use messaging or video calling to contact experts? </li>
            <li> Users also seem rather hesitant to use an app like expert: 25% wouldn't use it at all, 31.3% were unsure about it.</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <h4>Can´t find relevant information</h4>
              <p>To make a career choice, users want to find information on entry requirements, work tasks, salary and promotion opportunities.
                However, they can't find those information when they look for careers online.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Search as entry barrier</h4>
              <p>When users don't have a clear idea about their careers or as foreigners, it can be hard to think of search terms and know what to look for.
                Search is further complicated by mismatched results.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Vague information & complex language</h4>
              <p>When users are on sites and want to make sense of the information, they face obstacles like vague information and complex language in job ads.
                This makes it difficult for them to know what to expect and decide if it's worth to pursue
                the profession.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Messaging first, video calling second</h4>
              <p>For initial contact users would prefer to message the expert, since they don't know him yet.
                Video calling seems to be rather suited for later, when they have established a relationship with the expert.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>About me, professional experience & reviews</h4>
              <p>Users would look at the about me sections to get a first impression on the expert,
                check his professional experience and read reviews of others to estimate if the expert is trustworthy, before they contact him for advice.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Experts should have industry knowledge</h4>
              <p>Experts should not be only knowledgeable in career consulting for users to turn to them,
                but also have industry knowledge in related fields users seek advice in. Such experts would rather be able to answer specific questions on a
                certain profession.

          <h3>Empathizing with the User</h3>
          <p>Using my research findings, I created personas to emphasize with the users and understand their needs, goals and pain points.
            As a reference throughout the project, personas helped me to stay on track and make design decisions with end-users in mind.

          <h3>Mapping out the Journey</h3>
          <p>Next, I moved on to ideation. I used my personas to create user journey maps in order to visualize the process
            Isabel and Tim need to go through to accomplish their goals in Expert:
          </p>
          <p>Isabel Lange wants to decide on her best job fit and will use Expert to browse experts,
            read their about me and professional experience and message the expert for advice on what profession might fit her best.
          </p>
          <p>Tim Becker has a specific job role in mind and needs to weigh benefits and costs to get a realistic overview of the role.
            He will use expert to search for an IT expert, check reviews on him and book a call with the expert for more inside
            advice in order to make a decision.
          </p>

          <h4>Based on journey maps, key features for Expert were roughly decided:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Sign Up</li>
            <li>Search for an expert</li>
            <li>Send a message to an expert</li>
            <li>Book a call with an expert</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>User Flows</h3>
          <p>Using the journey maps and personas as a guide, I created user flows in order to understand the specific tasks
            Tim and Isabel would need to do in the app and pages needed to complete these tasks.

          <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
          <p>Based on my user flows and journey maps, I created a first version of a sitemap.
            To validate the sitemap, I needed to find out how users would organize information that feels logical to them.
            To do so, I conducted an open card sort with 6 participants via OptimalWorkshop.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Card Sort Results</h4>
          <p>Most of the main groupings in the initial sitemap were intuitive to participants.
            Some sections were labeled differently, such as FAQ and Upgrade. Participants also didn't create separate categories for the two types of experts
            (career and IT experts), but grouped them into one along with a list of experts and search.
          </p>
          <h5>Results lead to a revision of the sitemap with the following changes:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li> Remove expert categories and make two types of experts searchable on one page.</li>
            <li> Relabel FAQ to Help and Upgrade to Payment to reflect users mental model.</li>

          <h3>Sketching out possible solutions</h3>
          <p>With my sitemap, user flows and personas in hand, I started creating low-to-high-fidelity wireframes
            for the key features by rapidly prototyping different solutions.
          </p>
          <p>At first, I created rough low-fidelity sketches on paper, which were later turned into mid-and high-fidelity wireframes
            and prototypes using sketch and figma. At the end of this phase, I had a high-fidelity prototype that was ready to be
            tested with real users.

        <div>
          <h3>Low-fidelity wireframes</h3>
          <p>Findings from my research gave me a pretty clear idea of what users would expect on an expert profile.
            An "about me" section on top where users can get a first impression on the expert, that can be expanded by a view more button.
          </p>
          <p>Next, Tim and Isabel can get an overview of his professional experience and read reviews of others to help them choose the right one.
            I also wanted to offer Tim and Isabel the simplest way possible to contact experts via two buttons on
            experts profile to either message experts to book calls with them.
          </p>
          <p>For the experts page the initial idea was to lay out expert cards horizontally including experts name, a related tag, a preview of his about me
            and a view profile button. The reason behind it was to save space and display more cards on the page.
            Through feedback, I later realized the cards were too small to account for longer expert names and multiple tags.
            So I changed the layout of cards in later iterations to stretch them out vertically.

            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>To validate the solution, I conducted moderated remote usability tests with 6 participants over skype.
              The goal of these tests was to assess the learnability and errors for first-time users.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Do users understand the web app and its value?</li>
              <li> How easy can they complete basic functions such as sign up, search for expert, message or book a call with an exper for the first time?</li>
              <li> What errors do occur frequently when they complete these tasks and how severe are they?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Errors were measured using Jakob Nielsen´s rating scale. I also measured satisfaction using the single-ease-question
              at the end of each test by asking participants to rate the difficulty of tasks.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Test Results</h4>
            <p>All participants found the app simple, straightforward and easy to use. They could complete 3 out of 4 tasks quickly and easily.
              Major area of confusion was task 2 (search for expert) and the lack of transparency for costs of video calls.
              The main challenges and errors experienced are listed below.

            <h5>Issue 1 (Severity 2)</h5>
            <p>Users found search results irrelevant and would have liked to search for "software developer" to find the expert.
            </p>
            <h5>Evidence</h5>
            <p>5 our of 6 participants would have directly searched for software developer, instead of picking IT expert from the suggestions.
              Two users were also confused about the difference between IT expert and IT consultant.
            </p>
            <h5>Change</h5>
            <p>I replaced the search terms with job roles and included software developer.
              I also changed the helper text in the search bar on experts page to "enter job roles" instead of "enter field of work.", which was a bit ambiguous.

            <h5>Issue (Severity 3)</h5>
            <p>Users couldn't distinguish the search results page from experts page and clicked on the search button in results to find the expert.
            </p>
            <h5>Evidence</h5>
            <p>4 out of 6 users clicked on the search button instead of picking an expert from the search results.
            </p>
            <h5>Change</h5>
            <p>Grey out search term on the results page to indicate the search is already done.
              I also showed relevant search results to make it easier to compare profiles and choose an expert from the listings.

            <h5>Issue (Severity 3)</h5>
            <p>Users were frustrated to find "check plans" button didn't work on the book a call modal, which informs them about the paid feature.
              They wanted to be more informed about the costs of calls before they book it.
            </p>
            <h5>Evidence</h5>
            <p>3 out of 6 users clicked on the "check plans" button several times when they first encountered it.
            </p>
            <h5>Change</h5>
            <p>I created a payment page and linked it to the check plans button. This page contains an overview of monthly plans and
              a FAQ section with most common questions regarding payment. Users can now check the costs for calls and can feel more
              informed before booking calls.

          <h3>Bringing Expert to Life</h3>
          <p>After having fixed flaws in the prototype through usability testing feedback, it was time to bring expert to life with visuals.
            I used gestalt principles and color psychology to refine the visual design for Expert.
          </p>
          <h3>Color Choice</h3>
          <p>As expert is career related, I wanted to keep the design minimal, professional and visually appealing at the same time.
            To evoke emotions of hope and optimism in users who are unsure about their career paths, I choose a harmonious color palette with blue and yellow tones.
            A subdued yellow-orange color stands for optimism of users to make a career choice.
            The blue tones represent professionalism, trust and expertise of experts.
          </p>
          <p>To ensure consistency across our brand, I created a design system.
            Finally, the design was iterated based on peer feedback and accessibility guidelines.

          <p>The expert project was a valuable experience in many respects. Going through the whole design process from start to finish brought not only joy,
            but was also challenging and frustrating at times. Through multiple rounds of iterations and trial-and-error on user flows,
            journey map and wireframes, I learned to be open to feedback and embrace changes to ultimately make the product better for users.
          </p>
          <p>I also learned to resist the temptation to add a lot of features, but stay focused on the core ones, that would be valuable for users.
            As expert is supposed to be an MVP, new features will be added and validated in upcoming iterations such as a payment flow for PayPal,
            search filters and the option to leave reviews on experts.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, I learned that the quality of your research depends on the quality of your questions.
            In hindsight, I would probably focus on user tasks more in interviews and test mid-fidelity prototypes before moving on to high-fidelity ones.
