            <div class="row">
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p><b>Expert connects students to industry experts for career advice.</b> The project was part of my certified UX design program by CareerFoundry.
                The goal was to create a <b>responsive web app with a mobile-first approach</b>,
                for anyone to instantly chat with experts in any field, to get advice on how to face their (everyday) problems.
                The web app is <b>free to use</b> but requires <b>payment for any video calls done over the platform.</b>
                Although the brief should be used as a guide, we had considerable freedom in finding a niche people could need expert advice in.
              </p>
              <div class="row">
                <h3>Project Background</h3>
                <p>I was motivated to create an app focused on career advice after I looked at the <b>representative study "Schule-und dann?" by Institut für Demoskopie Allensbach</b> from 2014.
                  According to this study:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>More than 50% of high school students have difficulties choosing a career path.</li>
                  <li>20% of students don't have a clear idea of what career path to take after graduation.</li>
                  <li>35% of them don't feel enough informed about job roles, apprenticeships, and study programs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These insights <b>inspired me to explore the problem further</b> and create Expert for people who are unsure about their career choice yet.

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Choosing a career path can be daunting because it's probably one of the most important decisions students can make in their lives.
              <b>Finding relevant information</b> on professions online can be <b>time-consuming. Vague information</b> on sites also make it <b>hard to know what to expect from a role</b>
              or if it's worth pursuing it. Asking family and friends for advice doesn't always help either.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem Statement
            </h3>
            <p>Students need a way to <b>get answers to their career questions from experienced industry experts</b>
              because they <b>can't find relevant information online</b> to get a <b>realistic overview of job roles</b> in order to make a career choice.
            </p>
            <p>We will know this to be true when we see <b>how many users use our app</b> to get career advice from industry experts and <b>recommend the app</b> to others.

              <li> Common pain points are <b>no option to filter content and irrelevant content.</b></li>
              <li> The most helpful features in an app to help with career choice are: <b>booking calls with experts, searching for career experts, and

              <li> Users also seem rather <b>hesitant to use an app like Expert</b>: 25% wouldn't use it at all, 31.3% were unsure about it.</li>

                <p>To make a career choice, users want to find information on entry requirements, work tasks, salary, and promotion opportunities.
                  However, they can't find this information when they look for careers online.

                  Search is further complicated by mismatched results.

                  This makes it difficult for them to know what to expect and decide if it's worth to pursue the profession.

            </p>
            <p>For the experts' page, the <b>initial idea</b> was to <b>lay out expert cards horizontally</b> including expert's name, a related tag, a preview of his about me,
              and a view profile button, to save space and display more cards on the page.
              Through feedback, I later realized <b>the cards were too small to account for longer expert names and multiple tags.</b>

            <h3>Bringing Expert to Life</h3>
            <p>After having fixed flaws in the prototype through usability testing feedback, it was time to bring Expert to life with visuals.
              To <b>refine the visual design</b> for Expert, I made use of <b>gestalt principles and color psychology.</b>
            </p>
            <h3>Color Choice</h3>
            <p>As Expert is career-related, I wanted to keep the design minimal, professional, and visually appealing at the same time.
              To <b>evoke emotions of hope and optimism</b> in users who are unsure about their career paths, I chose a <b>color palette with blue and yellow tones.</b>
              While the yellow-orange color <b>stands for the optimism of users to make a career choice,</b>
              the blue tones <b>represent professionalism, trust and expertise of experts.</b>
            </p>
            <p>To ensure consistency across our brand, I created a <b>design system.</b>
              Finally, the design was iterated based on <b>peer feedback and accessibility guidelines.</b>

            <p>The expert project was a valuable experience in many respects. Going through the whole design process from start to finish brought not only joy
              but was also challenging and frustrating at times. Through multiple rounds of iterations and trial-and-error on user flows,
              journey maps, and wireframes, I learned to be open to feedback and embrace changes to ultimately improve the product for users.
            </p>
            <p>I also learned to resist the temptation to add a lot of features, but stay focused on the core ones, that would be valuable for users.
              As Expert is an MVP, new features will be added and validated in upcoming iterations such as a payment flow for PayPal,
              search filters, and the option to leave reviews on experts.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, I learned that the quality of your research depends on the quality of your questions.
              In hindsight, I would focus on user tasks more in interviews and test mid-fidelity prototypes before moving on to high-fidelity ones.
