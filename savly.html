              <h3>Project Summary</h3>
              <p>
                Browsing through a lot of recipes online only to find several ingredients missing for cooking a meal can be a frustrating experience.
                Finding specific recipe ingredients to buy takes time; professionals often don’t have. Busy lifestyles and schedules
                leave little time to keep track of food expiry dates as well, leading to food waste. To solve this problem, I created the responsive web app Savly.
                It’s an all-in-one solution for keeping track of food, cooking with available ingredients, and buying missing ingredients through an integrated shop.
              </p>
              <h4>Constraints</h4>
              <p>
                The web app should be free to use but requires payment for purchasing ingredients over the platform to generate revenue for the business. It should also be built with a mobile-first approach and take advantage of the devices'
                capabilities. The project duration was set for 2 months.

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                When searching for a recipe to prepare a meal, ingredients are not always available. Browsing through a sea of recipes online is overwhelming and hinders professionals in making quick decisions when short on time.
                Once started cooking, their process is often slowed down because of inaccurate instructions and converting units from a different metric system by hand. Due to busy schedules, they also tend to forget to keep track of
                food expiry dates and throw out small amounts of unused food per week.
              </p>
              <p>
                There had to be a better way to streamline the home cooking experience and reduce food waste at the same time. After initial discovery research and
                validating assumptions with users, I was able to come up with a problem statement:
              </p>
              <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
              <p>
                Busy professionals need a way to cook quick meals with available ingredients because they want to use up food they already have but are overwhelmed by choices for recipes online and forget to keep track of expiring food,
                leading to food waste.
                We will know this to be true when we see how many users use our app to cook recipes with available ingredients they add to the app.

            </h3>

              To solve the problem, I applied the design thinking methodology during the project. It was used to understand the user, define the problem, and create a user-centered solution in six phases.

            <h3>Analyzing the Competition
            </h3>
            <p>
              I started off by reviewing 6 existing apps to better understand the problem space to find opportunities for Savly to stand out in the market.
              I also looked at customer app reviews and ran a feature audit to find gaps in their offerings.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the market was already saturated with recipe apps,
              creating an innovative product would be challenging. For this reason, I included 7 categories in the evaluation:
              strengths, weaknesses, content, visual design, UX, compatibility, and opportunities. These would provide more insights about different aspects of the
              interface and functionality to help differentiate Savly in the market.

            <h3>Survey</h3>
            <p>
              Next, I carried out user research to understand the user. I started by running a survey with 172 participants to understand the make-up of my target audience,
              learn more about the context of use, and get some broad insights into cooking behavior and food waste habits.
            </p>
            <p>
              The survey was distributed on Slack and Reddit for a wider reach and stayed active for 3 days.
              I chose a survey first because it was a suitable method to gain general insights from a large subset of users before diving deeper into their specific needs and pain points.

            <h4>Survey Results</h4>
            <p>
              Survey findings revealed that our main target audience are 25-34 year-old professionals who live in 1-2 person households and mainly follow recipes on their mobile phones.
              A majority of them have no dietary restrictions. 14.5% of users are vegetarian and 9.4% vegan. Over 70% use recipes to prepare their meals; however, frequency of use varies among users.
              The main source for finding recipes are websites and cooking blogs, mostly accessed through a google search. Although they use their phones to read recipe directions, mobile apps are rarely used for recipe discovery.
            </p>
            <p>A surprising majority (72.7%) of users does not buy groceries online. This raises the question of why that is and has to be investigated further as it’s conflicting with business goals for the app.
              To organize their shopping, 64% of users like to use shopping lists, 54.7% of them buy on impulse.
            </p>
            <p>When it comes to food waste, 70.9% of users tend to throw out small amounts of unused food per week. The main cause for this is loosing track of food expiry dates.
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusions - Definition of the target audience & product requirements
            </h5>
            <p>Survey results helped me narrow down the primary target audience to seek out for user interviews next.
              They also led to defining product requirements to build a responsive web app with a mobile-first approach that would be accessible through the browser,
              as this is the main way users like to discover recipes and follow recipe directions.

          <div class="wrapper">
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p> As a result of survey findings, I recruited and interviewed 7 professionals for a better understanding of their needs and goals.
              Recruitment of users was challenging and took longer than expected. First attempts to recruit survey users by following up via email were unsuccessful,
              so I changed my approach to recruiting suitable participants via Slack to stay on track with the timeline.
            <h4>Research Goals</h4>
            <ul>
              <li> Document user pain points and needs in current products they use. </li>
              <li> Learn more about task flows, common obstacles, and workarounds for cooking recipes with apps or websites.</li>
              <li> Understand how users keep track of food and reasons for food waste.</li>
              <li> Find possible use cases for online grocery shopping and understand reasons why users are reluctant to buy groceries online.</li>

              After the transcription of interviews, I used affinity mapping to make sense of my data and find common patterns in users' responses.
              With this technique similar responses are grouped into clusters. These were later used to generate insights.

            To form distinct personas, I looked for similar and dissimilar patterns across users in my research findings.
            As a reference throughout the project, they helped me to stay on track and make design decisions with end-users in mind.

          <p>
            To translate insights into requirements, I first brainstormed as many HMW statements as possible.
            Afterwards, I prioritized the most important ones in an impact-effort matrix to narrow down the scope for the MVP.

          <h3>Mapping Out the Journey</h3>
          <p>
            After the prioritization of features, I created user journey maps to visualize the process Ben and Nina need to go through to accomplish their goals in Savly.
          </p>
          <p><b>Nina's Journey:</b> Nina found some grated cheese in the fridge that will expire soon. She wants to use it to cook a meal but has no idea what to make of it. She will use Savly to find a recipe for grated cheese to prepare a dinner
            for two.
          </p>
          <p><b>Ben's Journey:</b> Ben wants to make a fancy bowl of ramen but doesn’t have the rice wine mirin. He looked for it online, but it was reasonably priced. He will use Savly to buy mirin through the app and have it delivered in order to
            prepare ramen later.

            <li>Search for recipe for available ingredient</li>

          <h3>User Flows</h3>
          <p>
            Using the journey maps and personas as a guide, I created user flows to understand the specific tasks Ben and Nina
            would need to do and the pages needed to complete them in the app. With these red routes in place, it would be easier to sketch out
            key screens and create the information architecture later on.

            With the user flows and journey maps in hand, I built the first version of a sitemap to organize pages for the web app hierarchically.
            The challenge here was to decide which pages would be accessible with guest browsing and which ones would require users to sign up.
            I wanted to identify key pages that would create enough instant value for users to encourage them to explore the app further.

          <h3>Sketching out possible solutions</h3>
          <p>
            Using the sitemap, user flows, and personas, I started creating low-to mid- fidelity wireframes for key features by rapidly prototyping different solutions.
            At first, I created rough sketches on paper but then took them to Balsamiq pretty quickly, as it helped me save more time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked on several iterations to experiment with different layouts on the homepage, recipe page, and onboarding methods, as the first solution wasn't always the best.
            Afterwards, I created mid-fidelity wireframes and a prototype in Figma to test my design in the next phase with real users.

          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>
            To validate my solution, I conducted moderated remote usability tests with 5 participants via Google Meet.
            I chose this method because it allowed me to ask users follow-up questions when something didn't work out and gain deeper insights into their mental model.
            The goal of the usability tests was to assess learnability and errors for first-time users.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Do users understand the web app and its value?</li>
            <li> Can users successfully complete basic tasks such as finding a recipe or buying ingredients through the app? </li>
            <li> What errors do occur frequently and how severe are they?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Afterwards, I used affinity mapping and a rainbow spreadsheet to organize findings and prioritize issues to be fixed. Errors were measured by using Jakob Nielsen’s rating scale. I also measured satisfaction with Net Promoter
            Score at the end of the test by asking users for their ratings on how likely they would recommend the app to a friend or colleague.
          </p>

          <p>
            The overall feedback was mostly positive, but test results also brought some critical issues to light.
            All participants found the app simple, straightforward and easy to use. Most of them could complete tasks quickly without any issues.
            The major cause of confusion was task 2 (search for recipe for available ingredients), the lengthy onboarding process, and data entry during checkout.

          <h5>Issue 1: Couldn’t find recipe for available ingredient (Severity: 4)</h5>
          <p>
            2/5 participants couldn’t find a recipe for grated cheese and were stuck on the task. Users assumed they would need to add the item to the fridge first to find a recipe for it. They also browsed categories on the recipe page to find the
            recipe instead of using the search bar, which was also overlooked by one participant.
          </p>
          <p>As a result, I enabled the option to add items to the fridge through the plus button and added copy and a button for users to find recipes for their ingredients from the fridge.
          </p>
          <h5>Issue 2: Onboarding is too long (Severity: 3)</h5>
          <p>
            2/5 users found the onboarding process too long and said they would drop out. They also didn’t know why they should add ingredients to the fridge as it was too early for them. The concept of the fridge and how it works was also not clear
            from the homepage.
          </p>
          <p>To solve this, I removed adding ingredients from onboarding to shorten the process and postponed it to a later stage. As soon as users complete the onboarding, they arrive at the fridge page where they can add their
            ingredients to find recipes for them. To make the concept of the fridge more clear, I also added pictures of recently added items to the fridge section on the homepage.

              They thought their personal data and address could be saved and prefilled. To shorten the process, they also wanted to checkout with PayPal on the cart page.
              Users also reported that some critical information was missing during checkout such as delivery costs, quantity selection for food items, and price displayed at each step.
            </p>
            <p>To address this, I added the Paypal button and delivery time selection to the cart to shorten the checkout process from 5 steps to 2 steps.
              Missing information about delivery costs and quantity selection has also been added to the checkout process for more transparency.

            After having fixed flaws in the prototype through usability testing feedback, it was time to bring Savly to life with visuals. As Savly is content-heavy, I wanted to keep the design minimal and modern to let the images shine.
            I chose green as an accent color to emphasize the freshness of products and dishes. As a number of people mentioned in the survey that they still use books and handwritten recipe cards, I decided to choose Libre Baskerville as a
            typeface to resemble the experience of browsing old recipe books. To combine it, I used Libre Franklin to add a modern touch.

            The Savly project was a great learning experience. Going through the end-to-end process from start to finish was challenging but also rewarding.
            The process was often messy, included several iterations, and going back and forth between phases when new insights had been gained.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going broad in surveys and narrowing the scope through user insights, prioritization, and user journey mapping was good because it allowed me to focus on essential features to not overload the MVP.
            Setting myself constraints also helped me to learn how to balance user needs with business goals to arrive at a solution that could benefit both.
