              <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>As part of my frontend specialization course by CareerFoundry, I had the chance to gain first-hand coding experience by building a responsive portfolio website from scratch.
                The <b>goal</b> of this project was to <b>build the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my design work to employers and my professional network.</b>
              </p>
              <h3>Challenge</h3>
              <h4>"How might we build a responsive portfolio site from scratch to present our work to employers in a unique way?"
              </h4>
              <p>A custom portfolio website is a great way for any designer to stand out from the crowd.
                Unlike Behance and Dribbble, it can offer unlimited creative possibilities to present your work online and to
                create a good user experience for potential visitors.</p>
              <p>Although I already had a portfolio on uxfol.io before, the <b>customization options were limited in terms of structure, layout, typography, and colors.</b>
                I needed a portfolio website that is easy to maintain and customize, to present my work to employers in order to attract new job opportunities.
              </p>
              <h3>Process</h3>
              <p>During the project, I went from defining the HTML structure, applying CSS styling for different screen sizes, to user testing,
                code quality assurance, and publishing the site on GitHub pages. In the end, I had a responsive portfolio site ready to be used as the main outlet of my work online.
              </p>
              <h3>Goals</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Build a responsive website to <b>present my work in a simple, intuitive, and visually appealing way</b> so that it looks good across devices. </li>
                <li>Offer potential employers a way to <b>easily find, view my work, and contact me.</b></li>
                <li>Being able to <b>customize the portfolio website</b> through basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>

            <h3>Content-First Strategy</h3>
            <p>First, I started to gather assets and create the content for each portfolio page to focus on the development of the site for the rest of the course.
              I created optimized images for mobile and desktop with reduced file size and resolution for faster loading times on the site and
              optimal user experience across devices.
            </p>
            <h4>Defining the Visual Style</h4>
            <p> To decide on the visual style of the website, I <b>defined the color palette, typography and created a logo to represent my brand.</b>
              For a <b>consistent look</b>, I chose a subdued color palette of blue and yellow tones, that is easy on the eyes and
              creates a welcoming mood for visitors. <b>Blue represents professionalism and yellow stands for taking risks to try new things.</b>
            </p>
            <p>For typography, I selected the <b>google fonts Raleway and Lato</b>, because they are easily accessible, readable, and modern.
              To <b>create a logo that's simple and easily recognizable</b>, I merged the letters of my name into one.

            <h3>Building the HTML Structure</h3>
            <p>After the content was prepared, I moved on to the development of the portfolio site.
              I started by creating an HTML structure for the header, body, and footer section for the homepage, about, and project pages. This would serve as a skeleton to hold my content.</p>
            <p>Using the wireframes from the brief as a guide, I <b>built the main part of my HTML pages using div containers to have more control
                over styling and layout in CSS later.</b> At this stage placeholder images were used, which were later
              replaced with real images using the picture tag, so they can be displayed at optimal size on mobile and desktop.
            </p>
            <h5>Work section on the homepage structured with div elements
            </h5>
          </div>
          <div class="image">

              <source srcset="img/portfolio/html_structure_mobile.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
              <img src="img/portfolio/html_structure_desktop.png" alt="HTML structure">
            </picture>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <h3>Applying CSS Styling</h3>
            <p> With the HTML structure in place, it was time to <b>apply some CSS styling to add a personal flair to the site.</b>
              CSS stands for cascading style sheet and controls how HTML is presented in the browser.
            </p>
            <p>First I embedded the google fonts I had decided on earlier and <b>defined text styling</b> such as font-sizes, font-weight, line-height for h1-h5 headings, and body text.
              Afterwards, I also <b>applied colors and added link styling for different states</b> to give my website the intended look and feel.
            </p>
            <h5>Link styling for different states</h5>
            <div class="image">
              <picture>
                <source srcset="img/portfolio/link_mobile.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

              </picture>
            </div>
            <h4>Button Styling</h4>
            <p>I also made use of <b>transition effects on buttons to make them more accessible and interactive for users.</b>
              CSS transition defines the animation between a start and end state.
              I used them to create a smooth transition for drop shadows on buttons upon hover.
            </p>
            <h5>Button styling with transitions</h5>

            </div>
            <p>
            <h4>Adjusting the Layout with Media Queries</h4>
            <p>To create the layout for the homepage, about and project pages I followed the wireframes provided in the brief. I made use of a <b>12-column grid</b> and
              <b>adjusted the layout for medium and larger screen sizes with media queries.</b> Media queries allow for writing code that will only affect the layout up, to or from a defined breakpoint.
              I used them to adjust the spacing between columns for larger screen sizes and to define font-sizes for h1-h5 headings for better readability on tablet and desktop.
            </p>
            <h5>Styling of font-sizes with media queries</h5>
            <div class="image">
              <picture>
                <source srcset="img/portfolio/media_mobile.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
                <img src="img/portfolio/media_desktop.png" alt="media queries">
              </picture>
            </div>
            <p>To check the layout and styling for different viewports, I heavily relied on the <b>"inspect" mode in google chrome to see the results of my changes</b> and
              do some troubleshooting when the positioning of elements was off.
            </p>
            <h3>Adding Interactivity with JavaScript</h3>
            <p> Next, I used Javascript to add some interactivity to my website by <b>adding a mobile menu, that could be toggled on and off on click.</b>
              The menu should allow users to <b>navigate the site more easily on mobile devices.</b>
              The challenge here was to keep the navigation bar for tablet and desktop and make the toggle menu only work on mobile.
            </p>
            <div class="menu">
              <picture>
                <source srcset="img/portfolio/menu_mobile.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
                <img src="img/portfolio/menu_desktop.png" alt="Mobile menu">
              </picture>
            </div>
            <p>During this phase, I had the issue that the menu still showed up in tablet and desktop view.
              After some experimentation and research on StackOverflow, I solved the issue by adding media queries to the JavaScript code.
            </p>

            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>Now that the first iteration of the site was complete, I conducted a <b>moderated user test with 6 participants via skype.</b>
              The testing was important to find and <b>iron out any usability issues on the site.</b></p>
            <p>The <b>main challenge</b> here was to <b>find suitable participants.</b> Recruitment over Slack and Reddit took longer than expected.
              Due to a lack of responses from hiring managers on Reddit, I <b>adjusted my recruitment criteria</b> to "anyone with experience of reviewing designers' portfolios as part of a hiring process".
              This opened up the pool of target users and enabled me to find suitable participants for testing sessions.
            </p>
            <h4>Main Goals</h4>
            <p>The <b>goal</b> of the user testing was to find out:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How easy is it for first-time users to complete basic tasks on the site?</li>
              <li>Can users find the information they're looking for easily?</li>
              <li>What errors occur frequently and how severe are they?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Issues were rated based on <b>Jakob Nielsen's rating scale</b> and ranked by severity and effort.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <h4>Key Findings</h4>
            <p>Most users found the site <b>intuitive, simple, and easy to navigate.</b>
              They could easily find my resume, learn more about projects and contact me. <b>The only major issue</b> encountered by all users was
              <b>long scrolling on lengthy project pages</b> with no option to navigate to different sections they were interested in.
            </p>
            <h4>Change</h4>
            <p>To address the issue of long scrolling on project pages, I <b>added a jQuery plugin for a dot navigation</b> you can see on the right side of this page.
              This allows users to navigate to different parts of the case study more easily.

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>My main goal was to build a responsive website that is easy to customize to present my work to potential employers.
              Through learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I could accomplish this and create a portfolio website with
              simple aesthetics that is easy to navigate and offers users quick access to projects, my resume, and the contact section.
            </p>
            <h4>What went well</h4>
            <p>Working on this project has been a rewarding experience. I enjoyed to see the website come to life with every bit of code
              I added. During the process of experimentation, user testing, and iterations, I learned how solutions can be implemented with
              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also gained a better understanding of working with grids.
              This will help me to consider technical feasibility when making design decisions and collaborating with developers in the future.
            </p>
            <h4>What didn't go well</h4>
            <p>I fell a bit behind schedule due to the recruitment of user testing participants.
              When working on other projects in the future, I will plan more time for recruitment and have a flexible recruitment criteria to start.
            </p>
            <h4>What could be improved</h4>
            <p>As the site will be a work in progress, I will continue to make changes over time.
              I plan to add a custom domain for better findability and add more projects to the site.
              As the number of projects will increase, I also want to experiment with a different layout for the work section on the homepage.
