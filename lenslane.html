              <h3>Project Summary</h3>
              <p>
                Finding a professional photographer who offers the style you want for your event can be a time-consuming process. Intransparent pricing, unclear availability, and generic reviews only add to the frustration and extend the time it
                takes to make a decision.
              </p>
              <p>To solve this problem, our team created a digital photography marketplace called Lenslane. It is built to connect local photographers with clients and speed up the process of finding and booking style-specific shoots for different
                occasions.
              </p>
              <h3>Constraints</h3>
              <p><b>Business:</b> The product should be free to use, but requires clients to pay a flat fee for booking different shoots. To generate revenue for the business, it also offers a monthly subscription-based service for photographers. As
                part of the subscription, photographers can list photo shoots on the platform to increase their reach and attract new clients.
              </p>
              <p><b>Technical:</b> The responsive web app should be built with a mobile-first approach and be accessible across mobile and desktop devices.

            <h3>How might we help users save more time finding and booking photographers for a specific style?</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Time-consuming search:</b> When looking for a professional photographer for their event, users have a specific style in mind. Browsing through portfolios, reading reviews, and narrowing down results often takes a lot of time and
              slows down their decision-making
              process.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Unclear pricing and availability:</b> Pricing and availability are not always clearly stated on websites, making it difficult to estimate costs and plan ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Lack of trust:</b> Due to past disappointments, it's also hard for users to get a feel for the professionalism and
              image quality of the photographer before investing time and money in the shoot.
            </p>

                <summary>Problem Statement</summary>
                <p>
                  Lea needs a quick way to find a local and affordable photographer for her wedding day because she spends too much time on reviewing their work and narrowing down choices online.
                </p>

              <details>
                <summary>Hypothesis Statement</summary>
                <p>
                  We believe that by building a centralized digital photography marketplace where Lea can easily find, filter and book photo shoots with trusted photographers in her area, we will speed up her search process and increase bookings
                  conversion rates by 15%.

            <h3>Desk Research & Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              We began by conducting in-depth desk research and analysis of 9 competing web apps to better understand the problem space and find competitive advantages for our product. The main goal was to use both methods to identify key problem
              areas we could investigate further in primary research.

            </div>
            <p>
              Desk research on Reddit and specialized photographer forums allowed us to identify current struggles among clients and professional photographers regarding client management and booking photographers. These insights were later
              used to brainstorm research objectives for user interviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through focusing the competitive analysis on strengths, weaknesses, search and booking experiences, revenue models, and load times, we were also able to find gaps in current offerings and potential opportunities to stand out in the
              market.

                <p>
                  We chose direct competitors such as sweet escape and snap squad based on a similar problem they solve, a similar target audience, and feature set. In addition, we also included indirect competitors such as fiverr and peopleperhour.
                  Through taking apps into account that were not directly related to our product, we could expand our vision and find better competitive advantages.

                  Forum insights revealed that the search and booking experiences have been problematic for users. For that reason, we decided to include them as criteria in the competitive analysis to see how different apps would handle them. After
                  the
                  analysis, we compiled our results into SWOT profiles to present our findings in a clear and digestible way.

                  key opportunities for Lenslane based on their frequency of occurrence, potential user value, and business goals.

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>
              Next, we recruited and interviewed 3 photographers and 4 clients to understand their needs and goals. To use our time efficiently, we decided to split the research. Yashika was responsible for interviewing photographers while I did the
              same with clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recruiting users was challenging and took longer than expected for both of us. After an open discussion about our struggles, we finally decided to go with the small sample size we had because our sessions were already rich with valuable
              information.

              After the transcription of interviews, we used affinity mapping to make sense of the data and find common patterns in users' responses.
              With this technique similar responses are grouped into clusters. These were later used to generate insights.

              Using the persona as a guide, we created a user journey map to visualize the process Lea would need to go through to accomplish her goals in Lenslane.
            </p>
            <p><b>Lea's Journey:</b> Lea is getting married in a month. She has already spent time searching for photographers online, but is having trouble finding one with her desired style.
              She will use our app to book a local, affordable and experienced wedding photographer with the style she has in mind.

            </p>
            <p>
              The challenge at this stage was to decide which pages would be accessible to the different user groups to support efficient use of the web app. We wanted to identify key pages based on the different content displayed for clients and
              photographers, and merge related pages for easy navigation.

            <h3>Exploring possible solutions</h3>
            <p>
              Using the sitemap, user flows, and personas, we started creating low-to mid- fidelity wireframes for key features by rapidly prototyping different solutions.
              First, we created rough sketches for mobile and desktop using pen and paper, Lucidchart, and Balsamiq. We then took them to Figma to build a first mid-fidelity prototype that was ready to be tested with real users.
            </p>
            <p>
              A key challenge was to adapt the design for mobile and desktop and to keep technical limitations in mind. For example, a first version included a calendar for checking availability on mobile, which was later replaced by a date picker
              for performance reasons. We also decided to design the desktop version at a resolution of 800 x 600 px to accommodate people with older monitors at this stage.

            <h4>Issue 1: Stuck on the task of finding a photographer (Severity: 4).</h4>
            <p>
              2/5 users were unable to find a photographer because they were stuck on the task. All users clicked on wedding categories on the homepage instead of using the search bar to find a photographer. They also didn't notice the filters in
              the search results and complained about information overload on the photographer page, which distracted them from the task at hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              To address this, we redesigned the photographers page by reducing the number of visible categories and improving the visual hierarchy. We also linked categories to search results to make browsing easier, and added a filter button for
              better discoverability.

            <p>
              3/5 users were confused about the difference between photographer pricing and pricing packages. It was also not clear how many edited images they would receive after the shoot.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, we created a new pricing page with a FAQ section to provide more transparency on costs and the booking process.

              2/5 users found the information about upcoming sessions on the dashboard confusing and thought the notification text was not clickable. One user was also concerned about finding a way to revisit his images later once the notification
              was gone.
            </p>
            <p>
              To solve this issue, we redesigned the dashboard. We placed notifications on top of the page for easy orientation and added image thumbnails from recent sessions to provide more visual cues to click on.
              In addition to that, we added a button to view images from recent and completed sessions for easy access at all times.

              Once issues had been ironed out, it was time to bring Lenslane to life with the visuals. The key challenge was to find an appropriate color palette that fit our brand. Using color psychology, we experimented with options ranging from
              green to blue to brown.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the end, we went with purple and pastel tones to emphasize photographers' creativity and elegance of photographic styles. In the same vein, we chose to use DM Serif Display combined with DM Sans to create a modern, friendly, and
              elegant look and feel.

                  To help users quickly find the right photographer for their needs, we created a personalized onboarding process that takes them directly to search results upon completion.
                  Alternatively, users can select the categories and styles they are looking for on the homepage and on the photographer page to find suitable photographers.
                  For a faster search, advanced search filters are available for category, location, price range and style.
                  Transparent pricing and detailed reviews on the photographer profile also help users to speed up their decision-making process.

                  Checking photographer availability can involve a lot of back-and-forth messaging that takes up a lot of time. To provide a simple solution, checking availability is now as easy as a few clicks. Users receive instant feedback on
                  whether the photographer is available for their event and can book directly from here.

                  When users are busy planning their event, the last thing they need is a lengthy booking process.
                  In order to create a quick and efficient booking experience, we limited the number of steps involved in the process, made use of default states, and pre-populated personal information for existing users.

                  Often, users have little control over the final image quality after the shoot.
                  This can be frustrating when images don't turn out as expected.
                  To give users more control over the outcome, they can add notes and reference numbered images to express additional wishes for editing.
                  After 48 hours, users receive their final images and can download them all at once.

              Although the outcome of this project is a digital photography marketplace, it was not the first idea we settled on. Initially, we started out with a problem assumption that focused on the lack of findability of photo walks
              and workshops online.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, after surveying users on Reddit and Slack for 3 days, our initial hypothesis was rejected. The majority of users hadn't attended photo events in the past year and thus wouldn't consider using a platform that improves
              the discoverability of photo events and workshops online.
            </p>
            <p>
              Validating our idea with users early on was critical to pivoting in a direction that was more aligned with user needs. By investing time in research and understanding the problem better, we were able to create a solution that solves
              user problems more effectively.
