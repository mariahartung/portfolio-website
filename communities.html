              <p>
                In addition to its B2C and B2B web products, Acme offers a social network app for caregivers to connect, post anonymously, and seek support on everyday challenges in care. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Previously, users could post questions on the app's feed and receive answers from other users. After some time, we noticed that engagement was low. Some users were reluctant to post in the feed because they preferred to discuss specific topics with peers in a more intimate setting. To address this, we created community groups to boost engagement and interpersonal interaction on specific topics.

              To kick off the project and put our hypothesis to the test, we ran semi-structured user interviews and a prototype test with 4 users to learn more about user needs and pain points around their day-to-day work and social exchange. We also wanted to gather qualitative feedback on the community prototype to see what's currently working and what is not.

                  We used semi-structured user interviews and a prototype test to gain a deeper understanding of user needs and goals. These methods enabled us to ask users follow-up questions to gain more insights into user needs and pain points than using a survey, which is more focused on the what and often leaves out the why.

              As the project progressed, one of the key challenges we faced was deciding where to place the search. Previously, it had been located in the bottom navigation bar. In order to make room for communities, we had to reconsider its placement and ensure that it was obvious enough for users to find. 
            </p>
            <p>
              To solve this, I created a sitemap of the current app and two other versions with local and global search. Afterwards, I asked our app developer Nitin for feedback on the technical feasibility of these options.
            </p>
          </div>

            </picture>
            <p>
              A global search on home would simplify the information architecture by allowing us to link home, communities and  jobs pages to a single function. Users would then be able to search for all categories from a single page. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Alternatively, we could have local search on the communities, jobs and home, as we currently have on the jobs page. This would enable users to search for content related to the page they are currently viewing. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, we decided to implement a local search in the header on home and jobs, since we already had a local search available on jobs and implementing it would require less effort than creating a new global search.

              Using the sitemaps, user flows and research findings, I started creating rough sketches on paper to explore solutions to the problem. At this early stage, I thought big and didn’t limit myself to the functionality of a first MVP. For this reason, the initial concepts included the ability to create and search for communities, as well as as sections of trending and related communities, to help activate and engage users even more.

              Early concepts included topic-based communities, such as "Challenges" and "Expats united", which were based on user preferences indicated in our research. To save time, users would also have the option of joining groups directly from the Communities page. In addition to that, they would also be able to browse different communities and view the ones they are part of.

              Using the sketches as a guide, I proceeded to create designs in Figma. After completing the first iteration, I shared the designs with Sophie and Yash for review in a design meeting. While this version was well received, we had to make changes and cut out some features to save time and effort on developing the first MVP version, as shown below.

              The final MVP version included the core “Explore Communities” and “My Communities” sections, where users can browse and view the communities they have joined. In this version, users will not be able to create their own communities and search for them yet. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I added a tooltip to help users discover the new feature after downloading the app. To help users get started on communities and meet up in person, we also pregrouped them into cities according to their primary location by default.

              After the designs have been completed, we moved on to implementation. The implementation phase included hand off to development and multiple rounds of QA on the community feature after the first MVP version was implemented. Due to lack of resources and time constraints we were not able to run usability tests. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In the development phase, we faced challenges in terms of scope and time. Our research showed that users would also be interested in local groups for in-person connection. To keep the first MVP as lean as possible and check if users would see value in the groups, we decided that we would only include city-based groups in this first iteration and save topic-based groups for later.

                    Sorting order of groups was incorrect. We fixed this with sorting by newest to oldest and include alphabetical sorting of cities for users to be able to find them more easily.

                    Web users were also added to default groups, which resulted in a higher member number than expected. We solved this by only adding app users.

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
              After the first MVP went live, we monitored usage closely in Google Analytics. Although we had successfully validated the problem with users, we saw that engagement in groups and user adoption remained slow. After a week, the first post appeared in the city group Berlin. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Consequently, we decided to improve the feature further and add topic-based communities in a second iteration, as originally planned. After this version was released, more users joined these groups, and there was more activity in the job search group.

              The second iteration included a tab navigation for topic-and city-based groups and also reflected the typeface and button style changes from the updated design system. We also introduced a "Create post" section on the communities detailed page to motivate users to create their first post and increase engagement.

            <h4>User adoption does not happen overnight</h4>
              <p> 
                Even though user research helped to validate assumptions, user behaviour can still be unpredictable. Users may take more time to engage with and adopt new features, so this process may take some time. For this reason, it’s best to adjust expectations.
              </p>
            <h4>Quick learnings over scope creep</h4>
              <p>
                During the project, we cut out many of the features that we had originally planned to avoid scope creep. By keeping the initial MVP lean, we were able to gather insights quickly and adjust our approach. Going broad and narrowing down to an MVP version was a good approach because it opened up our perspective on what a future version could look like. It also allowed us to build a backlog of ideas that we could draw from.
              </p>
            <h4>Test early and often</h4> 
              <p> 
                I believe that if we had time and resources to run usability tests on the first version, we could have saved some time and costs in developing two iterations to solve the problem.
